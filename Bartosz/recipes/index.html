    <h1>Homemade Hummus</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 15½-oz. can chickpeas</li>
            <li>1 large lemon</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>½ cup tahini, well mixed</li>
            <li>¾ tsp. (or more) kosher salt</li>
            <li>10 cranks freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ tsp. ground cumin</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>Za’atar and/or sesame seeds (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by prepping all of your ingredients: Drain 15½ oz. chickpeas in a strainer or colander and rinse thoroughly. Let drain again while you do the other prep.</li>
            <li>Cut 1 lemon in half, remove any visible seeds, and squeeze juice into a small bowl. You should have 3–4 Tbsp.</li>
            <li>Smash 1 garlic clove with the flat side of your knife on a cutting board and remove peel. Continue to mash with side of knife until a paste forms. (You can also grate garlic on a microplane if you have one—you're just looking for a fine paste.)</li>
            <li>Combine drained chickpeas, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, garlic, ½ cup tahini, ¾ tsp. salt, 10 cracks pepper, ¼ tsp. cumin, and 2 Tbsp. water in a food processor.</li>
            <li>Process until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>With the motor running, stream in 3 Tbsp. oil, then continue to process until hummus is very light and creamy, about 1 minute longer. Taste and season with more salt, if needed.</li>
            <li>Transfer hummus to a shallow bowl, top with za’atar and/or sesame seeds, and drizzle with more oil.</li>
        </ol>
